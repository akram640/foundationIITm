## L6.1:  Lists and Sets

```python
y = {1,2,1,2,34} # this is a set in Python
```

* Set is faster when searching an element in set
* Searching in list is very defficult
* Set takes roughly 10 times more space than a **list sizeof(set) > sizeof(list)**
* Element in set are not inorder.
* Set is best for searching operation
